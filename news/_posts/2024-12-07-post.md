Wow! Just, wow!  I have to admit that I was worried that there might not be enough people at the meeting or there might not be enough snacks. Boy was I wrong!!
We had 23 people at our first meeting, eight new members joined and paid dues and there was enough food to feed an army! Thank you to everyone who came and to all those that brought food. 
<br/>
Angelic gave a talk on scented orchids pointing out the wide variety of fragrances available from a plant that many people don’t think has a scent at all. 
We wrapped it all up with a great raffle table supplied by Angelic.
<br/>
Just a reminder,  at the December meeting will have elections!  We’ve had the same officers for some time now. Maybe now is the time for you to step up and pitch in… At least think about it won’t you?
