About 4 days ago, the SJ City Hall finally informed us that the second Friday was unavailable to us so we had to take the FIRST Friday.  Unfortunately this left me with about a week to find a speaker.  Other commitments came also.  Once again it's a last minute situation.  Sorry.

I realize now that the important thing is that YOU need to know that our November meeting is on NOVEMBER 02, 2018.  THE DATE IS THIS COMING FRIDAY.  I will find a speaker by then.

Yuko
