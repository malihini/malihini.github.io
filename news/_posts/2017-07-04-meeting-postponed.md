Our meeting room __is not available__ for our July 14th meeting at the San Jose City Hall.

Due to this, our __JULY meeting will be on JULY 21, 2017 (Friday)__.  This rescheduled date is one week later than our regular meeting date.

Our speaker will be Ernesto Sandoval.  I know that you will find him to be knowledgeable AND entertaining.  We hope to see you there!
