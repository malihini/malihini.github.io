Pierre Pujol has been growing orchids for a relatively short time
(since 2010).  A self-described orchid geek with a background in
life sciences and agronomy, Pierre immersed himself into understanding
orchid needs in order to grow his plants better.  He rapidly succeeded
in getting numerous cultural and quality awards with his plants.
Pierre’s plant Cymbidium tracyanum var. album “Woodside” received
a JC/AOS at the Oakland AOS judging (October 19, 2015).

Pierre will give a quick overview of the flask process. He will
then address the often dreaded step of growing seedlings from flask.
Pierre will also share the journey through science, humor, and
photos.
