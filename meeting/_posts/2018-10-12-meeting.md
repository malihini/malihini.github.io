title:  "Speaker: Chaunie Langland - The Uncommon Phalaenopsis"
date:   2018-10-12 7:30PM

This month’s speaker will be Chaunie Langland. A big fan of
Phalaenopsis, aka Phals and Phalies, she will talk about species
Phals, fragrant Phals, tiny Phals, huge Phals, and current awarded
hybrids. Yes, there will be slides. She will also perform a death defying
repotting for your amazement and edification. So sit close to the front
if you want to see that. Or sit at the back if you are the nervous type
and can’t take the suspense.

Chaunie is an active member of Peninsula Orchid Society and a dead
weight member of San Francisco Orchid Society and Gold Coast
Cymbidium Growers. She is in her first year as an associate AOS judge.
(That means her score finally counts!) Having retired from materials
characterization at the end of 2017, she dreams of becoming current
on repotting her orchids which she grows in her 8 x 16 greenhouse
and outdoors. No, you cannot grow Phals outdoors!

### Plant table
The plant table (opportunity table) will be supplied by Fred Clark of Sunset Valley Orchids.
