Chen-Hao Hsu acquired his first orchids in Taiwan when he was ten years
old. His passion for orchids and other plant groups continued after he
returned to the U.S. shortly thereafter. Prior to pursuing a graduate
degree in ecology and statistics at UC Davis, he interned for one summer
at Longwood Gardens outside of Philadelphia and briefly worked with the
orchid collection there. Currently, his travels for work and pleasure have
led him to many destinations both domestic and abroad. His most recent
travels have taken him to Mexico, Peru, central Africa, Brazil, Ecuador,
Argentina, Jamaica, Panama and the Philippines where he observed a vast
variety of orchids across distinctly different habitats.

### Plant table

Chen-Hao will supply the plant table. There will be a wide variety of orchids.

MOS bought some Cymbidiums from Doug Pulley. Many were sold during the
MOS Show and POGE Show. The remaining Cymbidiums will be used to
supplement the plant table. Thank you Bill for hauling the Cymbidiums to
the shows and taking care of (babysitting) them for us.
