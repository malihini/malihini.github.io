Dennis Olivas was born on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. As a lad he
helped his mom grow her orchids and got hooked. He joined the Future
Farmers of America and his project was raising and selling orchids.
In 1980 he moved to the mainland and swore off the orchid family;
not for long, as he was introduced to Rod McLellan’s 'Acres of
Orchids’. First he filled his home with upwards of 6,000 plants.
Later he leased greenhouse space for his collection. A glutton for
punishment, he continued to add to his collection, overflowing the
3,000 sq. ft. greenhouse in Half Moon Bay. Currently his greenhouse
(D&D Flowers) is in Daly City.

Dennis has been president of Peninsula Orchid Society, San Francisco
Orchid Society, Diablo View Orchid Society, and the Santa Cruz
Orchid Society. He is an accredited judge of the American Orchid
Society. Dennis belongs to over 14 orchid societies and tries to
assist them whenever possible.
