Dan Newman started growing orchids in 1982. His first successful
subject was a Dendrobium hybrid bought as a tiny seedling at a lei
stand in the Honolulu Airport. When that plant finally grew up and
bloomed a few years later, he was hooked! By 1996 he had 350
orchids in a one-bedroom apartment. That year he moved his plants
into a rented commercial greenhouse in San Francisco. He took over
the large species collection of his friend and orchid mentor, Walter
Teague, and his hobby evolved into his nursery, Hanging Gardens.
Dan started growing orchids full-time in 2000, and moved to a larger
greenhouse in Pacifica a few years later. Most of his plants are cool
to intermediate growers (really warm growers are challenging in
Pacifica, but it’s hard to resist trying a few). Species orchids make up his core collection and most of his
sale stock. He also grows a variety of “companion plants”, which share the natural habitats of orchids.

Dan joined the San Francisco Orchid Society in 1987 and served as its president in 1996/97. In recent
years, he has spoken on a variety of topics to orchid societies in California and elsewhere.
