Robert Hamilton is a second-generation Berkeley native, educated in the Berkeley school systems
including UC Berkeley. Beginning as a 19-year-old employee scanning bubble chamber photos at the
Lawrence Berkeley Lab while a student, his UC career spanned more than 50 years eventually
leading to manager of equipment and facilities for two successive semiconductor research labs, the
Microlab and the NanoLab. Bob began growing orchids with his partner, John Leathers in 1976. John
and Bob currently operate Hawk Hill Nursery, a California-licensed nursery specializing in cool
growing Andean orchids. Both have trekked the Andes in search of new species. Hawk Hill operates
its own lab. Bob is known for his seminal work in orchid chromosome doubling having received the
OAS Presidential Medal for his work with anti-mitotic chemicals to induce polyploids. In addition to
orchids, Bob studies classical piano and, since his high school years, has been an avid art collector.

Due to his generosity, Bob will not charge an honorarium.
