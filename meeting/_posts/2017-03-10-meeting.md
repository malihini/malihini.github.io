Ken was first introduced to orchids by his uncle in the 1960s and has been growing Cymbidiums himself for over 40 years. Over time, he has added the Odontoglossum alliance plants and several other genera. Since his wife Amy joined in his orchid addiction, they now also raise Cattleyas and Laelias, Lycastes, Encyclias, Vandas, and Masdevallias. Together they even have a few Disas! Their collection now numbers over 2500 Cymbidiums, and about another 4500 of the other genera.

Ken is a judge in the AOS judging program and the CSA judging program. He has written many articles for the CSA Journal.
