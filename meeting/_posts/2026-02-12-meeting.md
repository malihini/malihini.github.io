SETUP STARTS AT 7PM, MEETING AT 7:30PM

### Speaker <br/>
Pierre Pujol (remote presentation)<br>
Speaker will give the talk at 7:30 pm, so come early


Pierre will tell us about his experience hybridizing Cymbidiums. Topics will cover selecting parents, setting expectations, and analyzing the outcome. Pierre believes that "a picture is worth a thousand words", so you can expect to see many flower pictures of plants used for breeding and their seedlings.




### Speaker bio
Pierre has been growing orchids for 16 years, both in his backyard in Redwood City and in an unheated greenhouse in Half Moon Bay.  Pierre specializes in Cymbidiums, but his collection also includes more than 250+ cool-growing orchids of other genera.  These include Zygopetalum, Sarcochilus, Masdevallia, Cattleya, Dendrobium, Oncidium, and Stanhopea .

Pierre has an education in Life Sciences that he applies to finding the best culture for his plants.  He likes exhibiting his plants at meetings, shows, and making his own hybrids.


### Plant table
John Humphrey (our president) will provide (donate) the plant table.  He will bring 10-15 Cymbidiums.
