Well worth the drive out to bucolic Bolinas. California Orchids is only open to
the general public twice a year. Sale will feature orchid species and hybrids,
awarded plants, and some of proprietor, Mary Nisbetâ€™s favorites. Sale also
includes repotting supplies and an interesting group of staghorn ferns.
