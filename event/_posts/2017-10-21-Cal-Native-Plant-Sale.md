To take advantage of the Winter rains, Fall is the time for planting! The Yerba Buena Native Plant Sale is an opportunity to find a variety of native species that aren't readily available at garden centers. Our focus and offerings, as always, will be native plants local to our chapter area: San Francisco and northern San Mateo County, including Montara and San Bruno Mountains. These are the species already adapted to our area's climate, soil, and habitats - and are also import to our local wildlife.

Growing locally native plants in your garden is an important way to:
 * Attract pollinators, including native bees, butterflies, moths, birds andfor your pleasure and their benefit
 * Provide for endangered species, such as by growing host and nectar plants for the Green Hairstreak butterfly
 * Enhance corridors for native wildlife
 * Use less water (thereby less energy pumping that water)
 * Save money on utility bills
 * Reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides
 * Have a beautiful, colorful, lively garden
 * Inspire your neighbors to do the same!

Free Parking, and the 44-O'Shaughnessy Muni bus stops out front. check out our new website: http://cnps-yerbabuena.org
